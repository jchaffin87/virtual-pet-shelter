This app is an extension of the virtual-pet app I did last week. It creates a group of those same sorts of pets and has you manage them as a pet shelter operator.

The code is relatively simple and the gameplay is explained in the intro output. 

Things left to be done:
-write loops to check whether pet chosen for play and adoption are in the collection and have the user try again if not.
-make the case of player-inputted pet names match the case of stored pet names.
-implement a deathcheck as a lose condition and output a funny message including a plot-twist involving a robot uprising.
